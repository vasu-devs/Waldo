## Projects

BranchGPT (branchgpt.vasudev.live)

Git-styled Non-linear LLM Chat Interface

Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle, PG, OpenAI

- Built a chat architecture treating conversations as trees, enabling Forking, Branching, and Merging to solve context pollution during debugging loops.
- Engineered a recursive tree-traversal algorithm to dynamically reconstruct conversation history, allowing users to isolate errors in branches without ruining the main context window.
- Implemented 'Sibling Navigation' to explore parallel prompts and a Merge feature to synthesize insights from different branches into a single context.
- Designed a schema using PostgreSQL self-referencing tables to track lineage, enabling complex state management for non-linear dialogue flow.

## Vaani

Autonomous Debt Collection Voice Agent

- Developed a robust outbound voice agent capable of handling real-time debt collection scenarios with natural turn-taking.
- Integrated LiveKit with Twilio for telephony and Deepgram for low-latency STT, ensuring human-like conversation flow.
- Implemented interruption handling and background noise resilience to maintain high call quality in edge cases.
- Built egress functionality for call recording and automated transcription for post-call risk analysis.

## Odeon

Self-Correcting Voice Agent Testing Platform

- Engineered an automated testing suite that simulates diverse customer personas to stress-test voice bots.
- Developed a self-correction loop where the agent identifies failure points and rewrites its own system prompt to optimize performance.
- Tracked performance metrics including negotiation effectiveness, response relevancy, and repetition rates.

## Open Source Contributions

## Kana Dojo (690+ Stars)

- Developed and contributed four visual themes to enhance UI adaptability for language learners.

Animated Lucide Icons (5.5k+ Stars)

- Contributed animated SVG icons using Framer Motion to enhance hover responsiveness.
